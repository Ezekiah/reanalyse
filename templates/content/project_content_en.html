<h1>Objectives</h1> <p> The project's philosophy is based on several interlinking sources of motivation.</p> <p> Firstly the <i>raison d'être</i> of this database is to preserve the memory of research, by saving high-quality studies that may provide a valuable heritage for the future, and thus also to create the necessary conditions for a critical evaluation of past studies.</p> <p>Secondly, by enabling the research community to access studies with a high potential for re-use in various social science disciplines, particularly sociology and political science, BEQuali also aims to contribute to the development of secondary analysis of archived research. practice, which remains marginal in France, is likely to attract a range of investments from different areas. At the very least, a range of benefits can be expected from it: challenging the initial difficulties in the collection of primary data by reducing the costs of accessing new field-sites or difficult field-sites; using available data as much as possible to limit the intrusion of researchers into "subject" populations, in order to spare sensitive or marginalised groups; contributing to the optimisation and use of resources (especially financial) accorded to qualitative research.</p> <p>This instrument also aims to draw on reflection as to the validity of qualitative methodology in general. It will also be a key tool in the teaching of qualitative methodologies.</p> <p> The development of BEQuali, one of the three instruments of the "equipment of excellence" <a href="http://cdsp.sciences-po.fr/page.php?&idRubrique=dimeshs" target="_blank">DIME-SHS</a>, is part of a European and international trend. BEQuali is thus inspired by other archives operating in Europe, and particularly the pioneer qualitative archive <a href="http://www.esds.ac.uk/qualidata" target="_blank">Qualidata</a> in the United-Kingdom. It aims to bring new innovations to the exploration of studies and access to archived data.</p> <p> </p> <h1> Principles</h1><h2>Data Contextualisation</h2> <p> Our position in the debate on secondary analysis is the following: we believe that it is possible to archive data from qualitative studies so that they might be re-used by others, as long as the study is understood as a whole, and that the conditions of data production are known as far as possible – the aim being to reduce the risk of de-contextualisation as much as possible.  The holistic approach that we defend supposes therefore a prior exhaustive documentation of “raw” data. Beyond this, it implies the blurring of the boundary between “raw” data and “metadata” in the sense that the study itself becomes an integral part of the elements upon which the researcher must base his or her analysis.</p><h2>Studies Exploration</h2> <p> This principle means moving beyond the traditional archival and distribution model in the form of downloadable static files. Instead, we offer an innovative model for both consultation and archiving, in the form of "study-sites". These "study-sites" offer "research on the research" and facilitate the navigation between archived documents which enable a better perspective of the study as a whole. These solutions, which by no means aim to be a substitute for a detailed and systematic analysis of the data, provides new perspectives, both for the understanding of the processes of the original study, and for the exploratory analysis of the data.</p><h2>Ensuring Ethics</h2> <p> The operationalization of such a framework clearly supposes guaranteeing the respect not only of the rights of the researchers who archive their work, but also the confidentiality of the material that is archived and diffused. Therefore, any researcher interested in the consultation of “raw” data (interview transcriptions, ethnographic field notes and so forth) must imperatively sign a contract of re-use, in order to be able to download them. Similarly, with the exception of cases where the researcher has specific authorisation from his or her interviewees, the archived material is anonymized in order to preserve the privacy of participants. Finally a deposit licence between the database and the researcher submitting material for archiving will guarantee the latter that the conditions of archival and distribution of his or her data will be respected. </p> <p> </p> <h1>Prospective</h1><p>Currently structured around a prototype consisting of three studies, the database will be progressively enriched by the submission of data by researchers interested in the maximisation of their studies, and their re-use for secondary analysis or methodology teaching purposes. </p><p>BEQuali is also structurally linked to the <a href="http://blogs.sciences-po.fr/recherche-donnees-qualitatives/2010/10/04/le-projet-reanalyse-selectionne-par-lanr/" target="_blank">REANALYSE project </a>, coordinated by Sophie Duchesne (ISP-Nanterre), in partnership with Sciences Po (CDSP and Medialab), EDF R&amp;D (Grets), IEP Grenoble (Pacte), the University of Lyon 2 (Triangle) the University of Louvain-la-Neuve (Ispole). This project, financed within the 2010 research programme of the ANR, aims to test the archival and secondary analysis of qualitative studies. Three main series of studies will be archived as part of this, and will contribute to BEQuali’s catalogue: a series of studies using biographical interviews destined to study the recent evolutions in the way journalists in engage with different spheres of information; a series of territorialised studies intended to study the ethnicisation of social relations in low socio-economic areas, around the region of Vaux-en-Velin; and finally a series of studies devoted to exploring attitudes towards the European Union.</p> <p> These contributions constitute the first stage in the disciplinary enlargement of the database, from political science and sociology, to other social science disciplines such as political ethnology and anthropology, contemporary history and so forth.</p><h1>The team</h1><p><h2>Permanent Members</h2></p><p><ul><li>Anne Cornilleau - CDSP Sciences Po<a href="http://cdsp.sciences-po.fr/fiche.php?idFiche=5&lang=FR" target="_blank"> >></a></li><li>Sophie Duchesne - ISP Nanterre<a href="http://www.isp.cnrs.fr/equipe/duchesne.htm" target="_blank"> >></a></li><li>Guillaume Garcia - CDSP Sciences Po<a href="http://cdsp.sciences-po.fr/fiche.php?idFiche=20&lang=FR" target="_blank"> >></a></li><li>Paul Girard - médialab Sciences Po<a href="http://www.medialab.sciences-po.fr/fr/team/paul-girard/" target="_blank"> >></a></li><li>Pierre Jullian de la Fuente - médialab Sciences Po <a href="http://www.cee.sciences-po.fr/fr/le-centre/assistantes-de-recherche/355-pierre-jullian-de-la-fuente.html" target="_blank"> >></a></li></ul><p><h2>Other involved members :</h2></p><ul><li>Lucie Bergeyron</li><li>Alexandre Biotteau</li><li>Mathieu Brugidou - EDF R&D<a href="http://www.pacte.cnrs.fr/spip.php?article746" target="_blank"> >></a></li><li>Vincent Guilluy</li><li>Andrews-Junior Kimbembe</li><li>Adam Schaal - CDSP Sciences Po<a href="http://cdsp.sciences-po.fr/fiche.php?idFiche=21&lang=FR" target="_blank"> >></a></li></ul></p>
