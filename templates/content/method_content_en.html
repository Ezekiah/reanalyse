<h1>Research on the Research</h1>
<h2>Objectives</h2><p>The idea of "research on the research" consists of a global vision of the studies archived and their context.</p><p>This background aims, for each study archived, to provide any potential user the means to reconstruct the original research process and to closely familiarise themselves with the material, before beginning to work with the raw data.</p><p>
"Research on the research" fully symbolises the model of database we hope to establish, centred around the research as a whole, rather than simply around data. In this we intend to limit, as much as possible, the risks of de-contextualisation of data, but also to offer secondary users the possibility to better determine the interest that these archived studies may have for re-analysis.</p><h2>Principles</h2><p>"Researching on the research" involves an interconnected process of exploitation of written sources available on the archived studies on one hand, and the consultation of the researcher submitting the study on the other.</p><p>The raw data, their documentation and the publications based on them provide an initial ensemble of elements which together allow for the construction of a global understanding of the study.</p><p>An in-depth interview conducted with the researcher submitting the study (or with a member of the team who carried out the research) will bring additional light to the archived documents and allow for the ex post reconstruction of the different dynamics of the research in their entirety.</p><p>It is essential to have access to the testimony of the researcher submitting the study. Firstly this brings home the fact that qualitative studies are never linear in their development (hypothesis, operationalization, analysis and results) but instead go through complex developments in which the ability of the researcher to conduct the fieldwork and adapt to its surprises, and to make decisions at key moments and/or in unexpected circumstances, is of utmost importance. Moreover, these elements are rarely fully documented in writing which limits the detailed overall understanding of the dynamic - and unforeseen - aspects of the research process.</p><h2>Implementation</h2><p>This "research on the research" is the fruit of both the coordinators of the database, and of the researcher submitting the study. It seems necessary to associate the principal researcher as much as possible with this process, whilst endeavouring to enrich the data and to reconstitute the context of their production.</p><p>In practice, the interview with the researcher submitting the study is conducted after a preliminary investigation of all available documentation on the research, and the final product is the result of several exchanges between these different sources of information, as part of an iterative process.</p><h2>Presentation and organisation</h2><p>The "research on the research" is presented in two ways: firstly in the form of a chaptered audio recording, and secondly as a written document.</p><p>These two documents are structured according to the same model, which regroups all the aspects linked to the construction of the study, from its conception to its final publications and further use. In this we have been guided by the following principle: we have considered that what is necessary for the principle researcher to understand his or her own research is also necessary for a secondary researcher.</p><p>The research on the research is divided into 6 chapters<ul class="content_listbullet"><li><b>The researcher: </b>trajectory of the researcher and place of the research in this trajectory</li><li><b>The theory: </b>theoretical elements and initial hypotheses that guided the researcher</li><li><b>Fieldwork: </b>data collection operations on the field</li><li><b>Data corpus: </b>characteristics of the data corpus</li><li><b>Analysis: </b>protocols of the analysis and treatment of the material collected</li><li><b>Results: </b>publications and outcomes of the study.</li></ul></p><p>These 6 chapters are themselves divided into sub-sections, the number and themes of which vary according to the specificities of each study.</p><h2>Consultation</h2><p>The written document is downloadable online.</p><p>The audio recording is only consultable online as it may contain material that is sensitive for the researcher submitting the study, or for the interviewees. This explains why consultation is subject to the signature of an electronic contract stipulating that no attempt be made to download these files.</p><p>Each audio section is supplemented by a short written summary.</p>
