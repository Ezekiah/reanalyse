<h1>Studies Access</h1>
<p>Exploration of the studies is divided in three parts. These parts correspond to access status which are subject to different level of authorisation detailed below.</p><ol><li>List of available studies (status <b>"PUBLIC"</b>) : general information (abstract and descriptive metadata) on the archived studies are public.</li><li>Discovery of the studies (status <b>"DISCOVER"</b>) : the <b>creation of a user account</b> is required to have access to more precise information on each archived study. This status allow access to the "research on the research". In order to obtain a user account, it is necessary to be identify as <i><b>"researcher"</b></i> (e.g. lecturer or researcher from university or research centre, phd or master degree student - in that case, the approval of the master thesis advisor will be necessary). To request a user account, please <a href="mailto:info.cdsp@sciences-po.fr?Subject=compte%20bequali">contact the CDSP</a>.</li><li>Data access (status <b>"EXPLORE"</b>): the access to raw data is conditioned by an explicit and reasoned request for each study. The depositor will be informed of any request for access to raw data of his study.<br/> This status allows the exploration of the data and their documentation or the download of the entire study.</li></ol><p> <b>NB :</b> The request of the "Explore" status is possible only after the request of a user account (status "Discover").</p>
